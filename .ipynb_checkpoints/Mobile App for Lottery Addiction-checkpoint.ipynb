    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",

    "For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
