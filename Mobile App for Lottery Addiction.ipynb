    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",

    "A medical institute wants to try and combat this problem through the used of a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute already has engineers to build the app, but they want us to calculate some probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're dealing with probabilities and combinations, it will be helpful to have some functions that will do the math for us:\n"
