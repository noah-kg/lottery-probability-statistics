# Lottery Addiction - Probability & Statistics

A quick project to show the likelihood of winning a lottery, in an attempt to get lottery addicts to better understand their chances of winning. In this project we try to answer the following questions:

* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?

We will be using the [6/49 Canadian lottery](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) dataset as reference.
